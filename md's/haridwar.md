This sacred Ghat was constructed by King Vikramaditya (1st century BC) in memory of his brother Bharthari. It is believed that Bharthari came to Haridwar and meditated on the banks of the holy Ganges.

 When he died, his brother constructed a Ghat in his name, which later came to be known as Har Ki Pauri.
